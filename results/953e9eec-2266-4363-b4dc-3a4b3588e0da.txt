[rfc1.txt]:     IMP Transmission and Error Checking
[rfc1.txt]:   The software for the ARPA Network exists partly in the IMPs and
[rfc1.txt]:   the IMPs and it is the responsibility of the HOST groups to agree on
[rfc1.txt]:   sites met several times to discuss the HOST software and initial

[rfc1.txt]:   I present here some of the tentative agreements reached and some of

[rfc1.txt]:   always functioning and there are always 32 of them.
[rfc1.txt]:   The objections to the link structure notwithstanding, the links are
[rfc1.txt]:   easily programmed within the IMPs and are probably a better

[rfc1.txt]:   and are the unit of data transmission from IMP to IMP.  A 24 bit

[rfc1.txt]:   The operating system in the remote HOST must agree and send back an
[rfc1.txt]:   link to initiate a connection and both send request messages at

[rfc1.txt]:   parts, an essentially local, immediate and trivial part and a remote,
[rfc1.txt]:   more lengthy and significant part.  As a simple example, consider a
[rfc1.txt]:   user at a console consisting of a keyboard and refreshing display
[rfc1.txt]:   string of characters until a carriage return is encountered and then
